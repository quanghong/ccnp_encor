# Learning CCNP ENCORE & DESIGN
Hi!

I create this repo to track all my knowledge to study CCNP Enterprise. I have studied CCNP Route, Switch and TShoot few years ago at the time I had not known anything about coding.

After years totally focus on developing Network Automation tools. Now I think I need to improve my Network Design skill and also learning more about Networking cores.

I have searched and studied a lot of resources but I will resources I found that are the most helpful for me along the way.
Feel free to message me if you have any questions, I hope this repo will be helpful for you too!
